**Automobile Repair ER Modeling Project**

**Overview**
This project aims to develop an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a Automobile Repair company. The company specializes in automobile repairs and seeks to enhance their operational efficiency and accuracy in repair estimations through improved data management. This ERD will represent the essential entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities that mirrors company's business operations and needs.

**Project Context**
The company handles around 150 automobile repairs annually but faces challenges due to inadequate record-keeping and information management. An optimized database supporting detailed tracking of repair estimates and actual repair resource utilization is expected to significantly improve their service accuracy and business growth.

**Directions**
The task is to draw an ERD representing the structured data needs of the company. The ERD should reflect the relationships between customers, automobiles, repairs, estimates, employees (managers and technicians), resources (parts and equipment), and the consumable data associated with these entities. The final diagram should be submitted in PDF format generated from an MS Visio file.
